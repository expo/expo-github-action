> **Warning**
> This sub action is still in development and might change without notice. It is not yet ready for use.

## Overview

`continuous-deploy-fingerprint` is a GitHub Action that continuously deploys an Expo project using the expo-updates fingerprint runtime version policy. When run, it performs the following tasks in order, once for each platform:
1. Check current fingerprint of the project.
2. Check for EAS builds with specified profile matching that fingerprint.
3. If a in-progress or finished EAS build doesn't exist, start one.
4. Publish an update on EAS update.
5. If run on a PR, post a comment indicating what was done.

### Prerequisites

- Must have expo-updates set up with a `fingerprint` runtime version policy.
- Must be configured for EAS Update.
- Must have run the builds at least once manually in order to configure credentials. This can be done by running `eas build --profile <profile> --platform <platform>` for each profile and platform you have set up for this action.
- When using `auto-submit-builds`, must have configured [EAS Submit](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/) and run submissions manually at least once.

### Configuration options

This action is customizable through variables defined in the [`action.yml`](action.yml).
Here is a summary of all the input options you can use.

| variable                | default        | description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **profile**             | (required)     | The EAS Build profile to use                                                 |
| **branch**              | (required)     | The EAS Update branch on which to publish                                    |
| **environment**         | -              | The environment to use for server-side defined EAS environment variables     |
| **working-directory**   | -              | The relative directory of your Expo app                                      |
| **platform**            | `all`          | The platform to deploy on (available options are `ios`, `android` and `all`) |
| **auto-submit-builds**| -              | Whether to add the `--auto-submit` flag to the issued `eas build` commands.  |
| **github-token**        | `github.token` | GitHub token to use when commenting on PR ([read more](#github-tokens))      |

And the action will generate these [outputs](#available-outputs) for other actions to do something based on what this action did.

### Available outputs

In case you want to reuse this action for other purpose, this action will set the following action outputs.

| output name             | description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **ios-fingerprint**     | The iOS fingerprint of the current commit.       |
| **android-fingerprint** | The Android fingerprint of the current commit.   |
| **android-build-id**    | ID for Android EAS Build if one was started.     |
| **ios-build-id**        | ID for iOS EAS Build if one was started.         |
| **update-output**       | The output (JSON) from the `eas update` command. |

## Caveats

### GitHub tokens

When using the GitHub API, you always need to be authenticated.
This action tries to auto-authenticate using the [Automatic token authentication][link-gha-token] from GitHub.
You can overwrite the token by adding the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable or add the **github-token** input.

## Example workflows

Before diving into the workflow examples, you should know the basics of GitHub Actions.
You can read more about this in the [GitHub Actions documentation][link-actions].

### Continuous development on pull requests (recommended)

This example workflow continuously deploys PR branches to the development EAS Build profile and EAS Update branch. It will do a development build if necessary and display a QR code to scan to preview the latest commit on the PR.

```yml
name: Continuous Development (PRs)

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

env:
  EXPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 🏗 Setup repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: 🏗 Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
          cache: yarn
      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: yarn install
      - name: 🧪 Run tests
        run: yarn test

  continuously-deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency: continuous-deploy-fingerprint-${{ github.run_id }}
    permissions:
      contents: read # Allow checkout
      pull-requests: write # Allow comments on PRs
    steps:
      - name: 🏗 Setup repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: 🏗 Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x

      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      - name: 🏗 Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@main
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Continuously Deploy
        uses: expo/expo-github-action/continuous-deploy-fingerprint@main
        with:
          profile: development
          branch: development
```

### Continuous deployment on main (advanced)

This example workflow continuously deploys the main branch to the production EAS Build profile and EAS Update branch. It also does automatic version bumping and auto-submission using EAS Submit when applicable. Note that this still will require human intervention on the app store side in order to promote the submitted build to production.

> **Warning**
> It's unlikely that this is a one-size-fits-all workflow as project-specific pattens will require different strategies depending on your project's CNG, version bumping, and submission preferences. This example is only intended to demonstrate the broad strategy. It should also be noted that while this theoretically should work, it's unlikely that auto-submission on
every new fingeprint is desired as it could cause too many app store submissions.
