> **Warning**
> Expo publish is deprecated, but will be supported until 2024. ([read more](https://blog.expo.dev/sunsetting-expo-publish-and-classic-updates-6cb9cd295378))

## What's inside?

This (sub)action allows you to comment on pull requests containing Expo QR codes.
It can help speed up the review process by letting the reviewer load the app directly on their phone.

> This action only creates the comment. You still have to publish the project.

## Configuration options

This action is customizable through variables defined in the [`action.yml`](action.yml).
Here is a summary of all the input options you can use.

| variable       | default                     | description                                                                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **project**    | -                           | The relative path to the Expo project                                                            |
| **channel**    | `default`                   | On what channel the project was published                                                        |
| **comment**    | `true`                      | If this action should comment on a PR                                                            |
| **message**    | _[see code][code-defaults]_ | The message template                                                                             |
| **message-id** | _[see code][code-defaults]_ | A unique id template to prevent duplicate comments ([read more](#preventing-duplicate-comments)) |
| **github-token** | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | A GitHub token to use when commenting on PR ([read more](#github-tokens)) |

## Available outputs

There are a few variables available to generate the comment content.
Some of these variables are also exported as subaction output.
Here is a summary of these variables.

| output name         | template name       | description                                           |

| **projectSlug**     | `{projectSlug}`     | The resolved slug of the project                      |
| **projectName**     | `{projectName}`     | The resolved name of the project                      |
| **projectDeepLink** | `{projectDeepLink}` | A deep link to open the project in Expo Go |
| **projectLink**     | `{projectLink}`     | The expo.dev project link, including release channel  |
| **projectQR**       | `{projectQR}`       | The QR code link, to load the project in Expo Go      |

| **messageId**       | -                   | The resolved message id content                       |

## Example workflows

Before diving into the workflow examples, you should know the basics of GitHub Actions.
You can read more about this in the [GitHub Actions documentation][link-actions].

1. [Publish and preview on pull request](#publish-and-preview-on-pull-request)
2. [Sending preview comments elsewhere](#sending-preview-comments-elsewhere)

### Publish and preview on pull request

This workflow listens to the `pull_request` event and publishes a to Expo, on release channel `pr-#`.
Once that's done, it will comment with the QR code on that same pull request.
It's essential to keep pull requests separated, by release channel, to avoid writing over pull requests.

```yml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write # Allow comments on PRs
    steps:
      - name: 🏗 Setup repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 🏗 Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
          cache: yarn

      - name: 🏗 Setup Expo
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          expo-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      - name: 🚀 Publish to Expo
        run: expo publish --release-channel=pr-${{ github.event.number }} --non-interactive

      - name: 💬 Comment in preview
        uses: expo/expo-github-action/preview-comment@v8
        with:
          channel: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
```

### Sending preview comments elsewhere

You can also use this action to generate the comment without actually commenting.
By disabling commenting with **comment** set to `false`, you can reuse this action with any workflow trigger and send it to any service accessible in GitHub Actions.

> See [Available variables](#available-variables) for a list of all outputs.

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write # Allow comments on PRs
    steps:
      - name: 🏗 Setup repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 🏗 Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
          cache: yarn

      - name: 🏗 Setup Expo
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          expo-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      - name: 🚀 Publish preview
        run: expo publish --release-channel=production --non-interactive

      - name: 👷 Create preview comment
        uses: expo/expo-github-action/preview-comment@v8
        id: preview
        with:
          comment: false
          channel: production

      - name: 💬 Comment in Slack
        uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.17.0
        env:
          SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          channel-id: deployments
          slack-message: 'New deployment is ready!\n- Preview: ${{ steps.preview.outputs.projectQR }}'
```

## Things to know

### Preventing duplicate comments

When automating these preview comments, you have to be careful not to spam a pull request on every successful run.
Every comment contains a generated **message-id** to identify previously made comments and update instead of creating a new comment.

### GitHub tokens

When using the GitHub API, you always need to be authenticated.
This action tries to auto-authenticate using the [Automatic token authentication][link-gha-token] from GitHub.
You can overwrite the token by adding the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, or add the **github-token** input.
